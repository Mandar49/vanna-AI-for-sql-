    "value": " Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The game is played on a field with a rectangular 22-yard long pitch in the center. One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each team has a turn to bat and field.\n\nThe objective of the batting team is to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball bowled by the opposing team's bowler with the bat, and running between two sets of three stumps (wickets) placed at each end of the pitch. A run is scored when both batsmen have safely crossed their respective creases at opposite ends of the pitch.\n\nThe objective of the fielding team is to prevent the opposing team from scoring runs by getting the batters out or preventing them from hitting the ball past the fielders and onto the boundary, where additional runs can be scored. The most common ways to get a batter out are through bowling (by throwing the ball in such a way that it hits the wicket), catching the ball after it has been hit by the bat before it touches the ground, or running the batter out by throwing the ball at one of the wickets while a batsman is running between the wickets.\n\nCricket originated in southeast England during the 16th century and was first played in its current form in the mid-18th century. It became popular in the British Isles, the West Indies, and parts of what is now India before spreading to many other parts of the world. Cricket has a rich history and tradition and is followed by millions of fans around the world.",

    "value": " HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are three essential technologies for building websites on the World Wide Web.\n\nHTML is a markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It allows developers to define the content and layout of a website by using tags, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, etc., which contain information about the content within them.\n\nCSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of HTML documents. It allows developers to define styling properties, such as fonts, colors, layout, and animations, that can be applied to HTML elements. CSS separates the presentation of web pages from their structure, making it easier to maintain and update the appearance of multiple pages on a website.\n\nJavaScript is a scripting language used for adding interactive functionality to websites. It allows developers to create dynamic content, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the layout and behavior of HTML elements in response to user interaction or other events, and perform calculations and logic on client-side, without requiring a page reload.\n\nTogether, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fundamental technologies for creating modern web applications, with many frameworks and libraries built on top of them to simplify development and enable rich interactive experiences on the web.",
