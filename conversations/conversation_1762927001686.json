Here is an example of a simple implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm in C:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid swap(int *a, int *b) {\n    int temp = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = temp;\n}\n\nvoid bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {\n                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j+1]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid printArray(int arr[], int size) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};\n    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\n\n    bubbleSort(arr, n);\n    printf(\"Sorted array: \\n\");\n    printArray(arr, n);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `bubbleSort()` that sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The inner loop iterates through the array comparing each element with its adjacent element and swaps them if they are out of order. The outer loop repeats this process until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the array is sorted.\n\nThe `printArray()` function prints the elements of an array, while the `swap()` function exchanges the values of two integers stored in pointers.\n\nIn the `main()` function, we define an example array and call the bubbleSort(), printArray() functions to display the sorted array.",
