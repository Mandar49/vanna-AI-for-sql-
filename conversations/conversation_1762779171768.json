There are some issues with the data extraction process, which may impact the accuracy of our findings. Despite these challenges, we can still identify opportunities to boost sales for the next quarter. Here are actionable insights based on the available data:\n\n1. Identify top customers in the Infrastructure sector by analyzing order history rather than their industry association. These customers seem to be relatively consistent with two or more orders in the past 6 months.\n   - Prioritize outreach and offer tailored promotions to these customers to increase purchase frequency.\n\n2. Focus on the most frequently purchased products, even though we faced an issue extracting this data. This information can help determine which products have strong demand in the sector.\n   - Ensure that these popular products are well-stocked and promote them aggressively to capture more sales.\n\n3. Analyze competitors' pricing strategies by obtaining their unit prices. Once we have that data, compare it with our own product prices to identify potential areas for adjustment or differentiation.\n   - Evaluate competitive pricing for the same products we sell and adjust our prices as needed to remain competitive in the market.\n\n4. Examine customer feedback on our products within the Infrastructure sector. Although we encountered an error, it's crucial to gather this information to understand areas for improvement.\n   - Reach out to customers for direct feedback and use their insights to refine product offerings and customer service.\n\n5. Keep monitoring industry trends and forecasts for the next quarter. Even though our analysis revealed empty data currently, these insights can provide valuable guidance as we plan for the future.\n   - Stay informed about emerging trends in the Infrastructure sector and adapt our sales strategies accordingly to capitalize on potential growth opportunities.\n\n6. Investigate promotional strategies used by competitors that have shown success in boosting sales for the Infrastructure sector.\n   - Learn from successful promotions run by competitors and consider implementing similar strategies to drive sales growth for our company.",
