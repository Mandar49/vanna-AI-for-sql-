    "value": " Summary:\nTo rank employees based on Year-Over-Year (YoY) improvement between 2023 and 2024, we first need to ensure that all relevant data is available and correctly structured. However, an error occurred when attempting to calculate the YoY improvement due to an unknown column 'TotalSalesThisYear'.\n\nActionable Insights:\n1. Verify the database schema for the sales orders table to ensure that the 'TotalAmount' field exists and can be aggregated using SQL SUM function.\n2. Check if there is any missing data for the year 2024, as it seems all employees have records for 2023 but not necessarily for 2024.\n3. Investigate the cause of the error related to 'TotalSalesThisYear' and rectify it by modifying the SQL query accordingly or considering an alternative approach if necessary.\n4. Once the issue is resolved, run the updated query to calculate and rank employees based on their YoY improvement percentage in descending order.\n5. Analyze the results and identify key drivers behind the improvements for high-performing employees, as well as areas of opportunity for those with lower performance.\n6. Share the insights gained with relevant stakeholders, such as management, to inform decision-making and drive further improvement initiatives.\n7. Consider setting up a regular reporting mechanism to monitor YoY employee performance and identify trends over time, which can help in making data-driven decisions for talent development and resource allocation.",
